# CBB Tools

## About

CBB Tools is a React-based project for editing, analyzing, and running simulations on bridge hands.

The initial emphasis will be on editing features not available or difficult to use with existing tools. The second
round of development will focus on accessibility. Later development will focus on analysis and simulations.
